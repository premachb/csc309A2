Enter the home page through index.php
Enter the admin page through admin.php

I've added an .htaccess file that should work on the CDF apache enviornment the prof gave us, its the basic rewriting rules that are on the Codeigniter URL rewriting tutorial. http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/general/urls.html

When you reach the homepage you'll see a list of movies and theaters, you choose either and you reach a listing of showtimes filtered by either the theater you picked. Once you click Check Seating on one of shows, you will be taken to a page that will let you pick seats depending on whether or not they were booked already. (We didn't get the JS seat stuff completely done, but you can still select a seat but clicking on Book Now beside one of the seats if it is available).

Once there you will reach a form that is server and client validated, once filled correctly you will be redirected to a confirmation page where you can print out the output of the page. 


On the admin side you can populate the DB, delete the db, show the current showtimes and tickets purchased as requested"
